# Denko ICT Windows Deployment Configuration - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to the `sample-autounattend.xml` file to address the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Regional Settings & Locale Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Mixed locale settings causing 12-hour clock and English regional settings
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed `SystemLocale` from `en-US` to `nl-NL`
  - Changed `UserLocale` from `en-US` to `nl-NL`
  - Changed `InputLocale` from `0409:00020409` to `0409:00000409` (US International keyboard)
- **Result**: 24-hour clock, Dutch regional settings for date/time/currency

### 2. Authentication & Auto-Login ✅
- **Issue**: DenkoAdmin account auto-logs in without requiring password setup
- **Fix**: 
  - Set `AutoLogon.Enabled` to `false`
  - Set `AutoLogon.LogonCount` to `0`
- **Result**: User must set password for DenkoAdmin after first reboot

- **Fix**: Enhanced `SetColorTheme.ps1` with:
  - Proper Windows 11 dark wallpaper (`img19.jpg`)
